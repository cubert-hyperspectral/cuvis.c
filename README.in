cuvis.c is the cuvis.hub landing page for the Cuvis SDK written in C ([available here](https://github.com/cubert-hyperspectral/cuvis.sdk)).

This SDK enables operating Cubert GmbH Hyperspectral Cameras, as well as, 
analyzing data directly from the corporate data format(s).

For other supported program languages, please have a look at the 
source code page.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need to install the Cuvis C SDK from [here](https://cloud.cubert-gmbh.de/index.php/s/m1WfR66TjcGl96z).

### Importing Cuvis C SDK via CMake 

First, you need to add the directory containing *FindCuvis.cmake* to *CMAKE_MODULE_PATH*. Assuming you added the *cuvis.c* repository as submodule as "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cuvis.c" you can add it like so:
```
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cuvis.c")
```

Then you need to run the *find_package* function:
```
find_package(Cuvis REQUIRED 3.2.0)
```

If cuvis is installed to default locations, they are found automatically. Else, locate the cuvis.lib and the directory containing cuvis.h.

Finally, link against *cuvis::c*. In the following example, the target *main* is linked against cuvis:
```
add_executable(main main.c)
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE cuvis::c)
```


## How to ...

### Getting started

We provide an additional example repository [here](https://github.com/cubert-hyperspectral/cuvis.c.examples),
covering some basic applications.

Further, we provide a set of example measurements to explore [here](https://cloud.cubert-gmbh.de/index.php/s/3oECVGWpC1NpNqC).
These measurements are also used by the examples mentioned above.
